            <h1>Vermont's Response: 100 Days of President Trump</h1>
            <h5>from Vermont Public Radio</h5>
            <h5>April 2017</h5>
            <h4>We've spent the past few weeks gathering reactions to the first 100 days of the Trump administration. We wanted to know if anything about President Trump has surprised you or concerned you or made you feel relieved. Have you felt different these past 100 days? Have you changed? Has your community changed?</h4>
            <h4>Most of all, we wanted to check the pulse of the region in this moment, nearly 100 days in.</h4>
            <h4>We asked a simple question: <b><i>How are you feeling?</b></i></h4>
            <h4>Here is some of what we heard.</h4>
